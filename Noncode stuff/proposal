PRIMARY IDEA: Web App to find recipes based on ingredients

  For our primary idea, we would like to create a web application that displays a variety of recipes that include ingredients that the
user inputs. For instance, a user may want to find recipes including paprika to make use of it in his/her pantry. Our database will include
recipes and ingredients to find the best matches. We will utilize the Recipe Search API to find the top recipes based on the inputted 
ingredients as well as the Nutritionix API to display nutirition facts on the dishes displayed. Third-party authentication will be
enabled through Gmail login.

SECONDARY IDEA: App to track medication side effects

  For our secondary idea, we would like to create an app that tracks medication side effects based on a variety of factors
including what the user ate and what medications they are taking at a certain time. Our database will include medications and
side effects to correlate what is causing the symptoms. We will utilize the Health API and the GoodRX API to display dosage options for
various drugs. Third-party authentication will be enabled through Gmail login.
